# Top terms for a Twitter user

This single page app takes a Twitter screen name and returns their
most recently tweeted words.  The idea was to put this into a
d3-powered word cloud but I was having a hard time getting d3 and
React to play nicely.

## Installation

Run `script/install.sh`.  This downloads the files `nltk` requires to
tokenize its input.

## Running

```
cd app
python main.py
```
